The solution involves avoiding the direct evaluation of the length of the infinite list. Instead, we can use a different approach that processes the list without forcing the computation of the entire sequence.

```haskell
import Data.List (take)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let infiniteList = [1..]
  let firstFive = take 5 infiniteList
  print (length firstFive) -- Safe: processing a finite portion of the list
```
This revised code uses `take` to create a finite sublist before applying the `length` function, preventing stack overflow.
